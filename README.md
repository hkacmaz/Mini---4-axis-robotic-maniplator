# Mini---4-axis-robotic-maniplator
Controlled by arduino mega; 2 arms, one rotate around itself and 1 gripper. Assignable home and target positions.
Every axis has a control by joysticks, including for gripper.
Main goal is to set a home and target position for a gripper.
Then once we ready we hit the start and the robot will take the home position & get the object with the gripper.
Then it will move to already set target position to leave the carried object.
